# vagrant

**This project has been continued at [SIL Integration Testing Framework](https://github.com/sillsdev/Integration-Testing-Framework).**

vagrant files and machines

* Use vagrant file
* Mark "Auto login" checkmark in gui by hand
* Might have to reconfigure `dpkg-reconfigure debconf` to be readline instead of diaglogue! (not needed)
* Must switch machine to default use gnome before running sikuli scripts

* A working machine can be found at rrmhearts' dropbox /SIL 
    * https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qm0bq6909po6uhh/AAAKRhciXSiWRww_WCIq7TZea?dl=0
    * Download all files into a folder. 
    * Assuming you have Vagrant installed along with Virtualbox 4.3.30, do.cmd should work
    * Installs and automates tests on FLEX
